<p><pre><b>  Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils</b>, archaically called <b>"Pupin coils"</b>, followed closely on the pioneering work
of the English physicist and mathematician <b>Oliver Heaviside</b>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years.
The importance of the patent was made clear when <strong>the American rights
to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T)</strong>, making him wealthy.
 Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it,
as they already had their own development in hand led by <b>George Campbell</b> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.
 AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable
due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and <u>especially submarine ones</u>.</pre></p>
